226566043,'⚠️ A trading or investing lesson worth soaking in: One of the biggest misconception 90% traders all have is if they don’t sell a losing position they don’t have a loss. It’s further from the truth. A stock loss whether you keeping it or sold it is a loss period. Imagine if your car is damaged and decided not to repair it at any given moment in time it’s a loss Until the car is fixed by you or if the car insurance chips in the cost of repair. Don’t cloud your DD judgement with this incorrect mindset. $LK $ALT $SORO $CEMI','2020-07-09T20:25:08Z'
